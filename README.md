 This project is a 3D customizer for shirts, built with React, Three.js, and Vite, allowing users to personalize and visualize their own unique shirt designs in a three-dimensional environment. The application provides a seamless and interactive experience, leveraging the power of these technologies.

## Features
3D Shirt Rendering: The customizer utilizes Three.js, a popular 3D library, to render a realistic representation of the shirt, enabling users to visualize their design choices in real-time.

Customization Options: Users can modify various aspects of the shirt design, including color, patterns, logos, and text. The customizer provides a user-friendly interface to easily adjust and experiment with different combinations.

Real-Time Preview: As users make changes to the shirt design, the application updates the 3D preview in real-time, allowing them to see the immediate impact of their customization choices.

Camera Controls: The application provides intuitive camera controls, powered by React, allowing users to zoom, rotate, and pan around the 3D shirt model for a detailed view of their customizations.

Fast Development: The project utilizes Vite as a modern build tool, providing quick development server setup and hot module replacement for an efficient development workflow.
